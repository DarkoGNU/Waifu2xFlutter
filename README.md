# waifu2x_flutter

Waifu2x GUI in Flutter. The project was abandoned by me due to technical difficulties. Basic GUI is done, waifu2x isn't implemented.

Note: at the moment, settings (theme and language) can't be manually changed. The theme follows the system, the language is always English.

## Why waifu2x wasn't implemented?

Implementing this functionality is pretty tough. There are two ways to do that:

- rent a GPU server and process images in the backend - easy, but too expensive for me
- compile waifu2x for Android and make a Dart package from it - a little hard, I wasn't motivated enough to do it this way
